# Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles. I'm using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them from the home directory.

## Joemacs
Emacs config heavily inspired by David Wilson

## QTile
Window manager

## Alacritty
Lightweight terminal config. Dependent on [alacritty-theme](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme).
